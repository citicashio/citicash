Aliases
Alias is created by sending normal transaction containing extra information: 1) the alias, 2) wallet address, 3) alias signed by the wallet (for verification).
Maximum alias size is 42 and can contain case-insensitive letters (big converted to small), digits and following characters: '-', '_', '.' and '@'.
You need to wait 10 blocks before the alias can be used.
Everytime you send a transaction to the alias instead of an address, the wallet asks a daemon about the alias and receives it's address, which is then used in the transaction.
Aliases are stored both in the blockchain and in the memory to be as fast as possible.

Payment note
We changed original payment_id which could only have exactly 8 or 64 hex-characters to more useful payment note that can contain text.
Maximum payment_id size is 32 and can contain both lower- and upper-case letters, digits and following characters: '/', '-', '?', ':', '(', ')', '.', ',', '_', '+' and ' '.

Mixin
Minimum and default mixin amount is 6 (Monero allowed transactions without mixin in the past and they still allow mixin as low as 1 currently => that allows a minimum of only 2 outs mixed together).

Transaction and block sizes
Maximum transaction size set to 0.5MB.
Maximum block size that isn't checked is 5MB, bigger blocks checked to be under twice the median size of last 60 blocks (~1 hour).

Difficulty set so block is mined every ~1 minute.
Merged CryptoNight v2 to add resistance against ASIC mining.

Improved wallet backend interfaces for desktop wallet frontend so it can be as fast and simple as possible.
- get_transfers pagination
- get_transfers filter_by_timestamp
- show_transfers improved
- getblock improved
- unlock_time improved
- other
Improved wallet backend interfaces for web and mobile wallets that are coming soon (now under testing).

Improved export/import of the blockchain.
Improved wallet backend login storing (in memory instead of a file).
Added reuse of ports for wallet backend.
Fixed do_not_relay parameter not working for transactions, that prevented retrieving data for transactions before they are actually sent.

Removed DNS checkpoint checking from the code (because it does not add any more security than having only hard-coded checkpoints).
Removed deprecated Berkeley DB and code for unused databases.
Removed no longer used old methods for transactions.
Removed strange behaviour that provided only 269736 bytes of space for transactions inside block (SUMOKOIN and Ryo Currency problem).
Removed poorly designed output restriction in restricted mode.

Maintenance, fixing security problems, merging commits from Monero and others.
Nowadays we work on Kovri to be started automatically with the daemon.
